<img src="https://cookwithrenu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Puran-Poli_Featured-Image-500x500.jpg" alt class="img-thumbnail" height="200" width="200"> <br>
<b>Ingredients : </b><br>
300gms. chana (yellow gram) dal<br>
300 gms. jaggery (molasses) or sugar<br>
1 tsp. cardamom powder<br>
150 gms. plain flour<br>
1 tbsp. ghee<br>
warm water to knead dough<br>
ghee to serve 
<br><br>
<b>Method</b> <br>
Boil dal in plenty of water till soft but not broken. Drain in a colander
for 10-15 minutes. Pass through an almond grater little by little till all
dal is grated. Mash jaggery till lumps break. Mix well into dal. Put mixture
in a heavy saucepan and cook till a soft lump is formed Take care to stir
continuously, so as not to charr. Keep aside.<br>
Mix ghee with flour, add enough water to make a soft pliable dough. Take a
morsel sized ball of dough, roll into a 4" round. Place same sized ball
of filling in centre, life all round and seal. Reroll carefully to a 6"
diameter round. Roast on warm griddle till golden brown.<br>
Repeat other side.<br>
Take on serving plate. Apply a tsp. of ghee all over top.<br>
OR<br>
Shallow fry on griddle like a paratha for a better flavour. But this method
will consume more ghee and therefore increase the calorie level.<br>
Serve hot with dal or amti. <br>
<b>Note: </b>The water drained from boiling dal is used to make the amti. (
a thin curry made using black pepper, garam masala and some mashed dal.)<br>

<img src="https://vaya.in/recipes/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Baked-Millet-Gujia.jpg" alt class="img-thumbnail" height="250" width="200"><br>
<b>Ingredients :</b><br>
500 gms maida (flour)<br>
1kg khoya<br>
3tbsps kismis (raisins)<br>
200 gms almonds (cut into thin strips)<br>
6 tbsps cooking oil. ( keep some more aside for deep frying)<br>
200 ml water.<br>
500 gms sugar.<br>
<br>


<b>Method </b><br>
Mix six tablespoons of oil with maida. Using fingers, mix well so that the
mixture takes the form of breadcrumbs and binds to a certain extent. Now add
some water and knead lightly. Keep adding water as required and knead into a
soft dough. Set aside and cover with a damp cloth. <br>
Put the khoya in a deep-frying pan and fry to a light brown colour. Add
sugar into the khoya and mix well. Add almonds and kismis. Fry for a few
minutes and remove from the fire. Let it cool.<br>
Roll out the kneaded dough into a chapati, thicker and smaller than a
normal chapati. Fill half the chapati with the khoya mixture, fold the
chapati and seal the round, twisting the edges inwards. Take care that the
filling does not ooze out. <br>
<br>
Deep fry these gujjias, a few at a time, till they are a deep golden brown.
Fry on a slow fire. When done, take them out with a sieve type ladle,
draining the oil completely. Let them drain further on a spread out
newspaper, till all the grease is soaked up. <br>

some oil on your palm and roll out the dough into a long strip about one
inch thick. Cut the roll into inch size pieces. Keep rubbing oil on your
palms to keep the roll moist. Flatten each piece out into a round shape and
roll it into small chapatis. Lightly dust both sides of the small chapatis
or papris with maida. <br>

    <h3>7. Sherbet</h3>
    <img src="https://masalaandchai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Thandai.jpg" alt class="img-thumbnail" height="200" width="200"><br>
    <b>Ingredients:</b> <i> (For 4 glasses)</i><br>
    2 cups of water.<br>
    2 cups of milk. <br>
    Mishri(rock sugar)/normal sugar according to taste. <br>
    Cashew nuts. <br>
    Almonds. <br>
    Pista nuts. <br>
    Dry/fresh rose petals(if not available, use rose water). <br>
    Saffron. <br>
    Any other dry fruits of preference.

    <br><br>
    <b>Method:</b> <br>
    Soak the dry fruits in water overnight. If in a hurry, soak them for at least 2 hours. Add a pinch of saffron to about ½ cup of milk and let it rest. Take two cups of water and soak the rock sugar until dissolved. If you are using normal sugar, you can add it later in the process. Peel off the skin of the almonds and remove the shell of the pista nuts. Now put the milk in the blender and add the dry fruits and rose petals or 2 teaspoons of rosewater. If your rock sugar is not dissolved, you can also add that. Blend it well. Strain the mixture and put it in a utensil. Put the sweetened water and the saffron-milk and mix well. To cool it, you can keep it in an earthenware or add ice cubes to it. 
   Viola! Your sherbet is ready!!
