        <h2>Holi</h2> <br>
Holi is considered as one of the most revered and celebrated festivals of India and it is celebrated in almost every part of the country. It is also sometimes called as the “festival of love” as on this day people get to unite together forgetting all resentments and all types of bad feeling towards each other. The great Indian festival lasts for a day and a night, which starts in the evening of Purnima or the Full Moon Day in the month of Falgun. It is celebrated with the name Holika Dahan or Choti Holi on first evening of the festival and the following day is called Holi. In different parts of the country it is known with different names.

The vibrancy of colors is something that brings in a lot of positivity in our lives and Holi being the festival of colours is actually a day worth rejoicing. Holi is a famous Hindu festival that is celebrated in every part of India with utmost joy and enthusiasm. The ritual starts by lighting up the bonfire one day before the day of Holi and this process symbolizes the triumph of good over the bad. On the day of Holi people play with colours with their friends and families and in evening they show love and respect to their close ones with <i> Abeer </i>.
    
<br><br>
<h2>Colorful Legend</h2>

The legend from which the tradition of playing colours started is full of colours in itself. The story goes that the very colourful Indian god, Lord Krishna was jealous of his soul mate Radha's fair complexion, since he himself was very dark.
Naughty young Krishna complained to his mother Yashoda about this injustice of nature. To placate the child, doting mother asked Krishna to apply colour on Radha's face and change her complexion according to his choice.
Playful and mischievous Krishna appreciated the idea and implemented it. The game of applying colours thus gained so much popularity that it became a tradition and later it turned out to be a full fledged festival.
<br>
Till date, lovers desire to colour and be coloured by their mates. The application of colours has in a way become an expression of love.

<br><br>
<h2> Spirit of Holi</h2>


    The sight of Holi is so beautiful to watch; as the entire atmosphere gets filled with the clouds of colours...And, as if to match with the cheerful mood of the people nature itself wears its best and most colourful clothes.

The energy of the people as they move out in groups, playing dholaks, singing songs in their highest possible pitch; completly drenched in colours but more so in the spirit of Holi - throwing gulal and abeer in the air and on the feet of their elders as a mark of respect- it is this spirit of the festival that makes it so delightful and memorable.

<br><br>
<h2>Holi Colours</h2>


Colours are the most joyous part of the Holi celebrations. They add life and vitality to the festival making it most vibrant of all.
