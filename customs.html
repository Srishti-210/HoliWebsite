   <h4> Holi is famous as Basant Utsav in rural India. It is one of the major festivals in India and is celebrated with extreme enthusiasm and joy. Gulal, abeer and pichkaris are synonymous with the festival. Elaborate plans are made to color the loved ones. Everybody wants to be the first one to color the other. In the ensuing battle of colors, everybody is drowned not just in colors of gulal but also in love and mirth. People love to drench others and themselves in colored water. Gujiyas and other sweets are offered to everyone who comes across to color.

                <p>Though the celebrations of Holi in South India are not as grand as compared to that in North India. Yet, what is particularly noticeable in Andhra Pradesh as in other Dravidian states is the heightened feeling of communal harmony. Here too, people participate in merry making. Besides, in the evening, youngsters play with dry colours and seek elders' blessings by putting gulal and abeer on the feet of the elders.

                    The Banjara tribes of Andhra Pradesh celebrate Holi in their own way. Graceful dances are performed by the colourful Banjara gypsies.</p>

                <p>Holi is regarded with the name of Phagwah or the festival of colours in Assam. It is a 3-5 day affair for the people residing in here. Though, all the local regions of Assam have the same rituals during Holi, Barpeta is known to celebrate it in an entirely unique and grand style. Many people from other parts of India, world and Assam itself travel to Barpeta to enjoy the Doulutsava!

                    It is known that Mathura Das Bura Ata was the first man to celebrate Doulutsava in Barpeta. Ever since then, the Doul festival celebration is being carried on in the same satriyaparampara (traditional way) by the devotees of Lord Krishna in Barpeta. People forget all their problems, agonies and sorrows during the DolJatra, another name to denote Doul festival in Assam.</p>

                <p>Holi is known as Phaguwa in the local Bhojpuri dialect. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a purohit initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and a lot of frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.

                    Holi Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well-wishers visit each other's family, apply colours (abeer) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually, this takes place on the evening of Holi, day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon.</p>

                <p>They collect the things for the puja that takes place on the first day of Holi. The arrangements contain Chhattisgarhi Jada that is a small tree made to stand in the middle as the Karma Dar. This tree is covered by number of dry wooden branches of other trees and leaves of rice. The structure looks similar to that of a Hut. A puja is performed around this hut, mostly in evening by gathering people around the place in Chhattisgarh.

                    
                    This puja is performed by a Baiga and the puja is for Holika. While all this is going on, the baiga cuts the Chhattisgarhi Jada from the middle with the help of an axe. This happens as soon as the top of dry grass burns off. This Jada tree has a lot of significance to Holi, all the participants of the puja come to grab a piece of it as soon as Baiga cuts a part of it out from the flame. It is believed that taking home of this tree piece keeps the diseases and illness away from the homes.
                    
                    People celebrate and pay homage by burning the hut, singing songs, dancing and enjoying around it. It takes around 2 to 3 hours for all this to complete. At the end of the ritual, people throw and dry grass in the burnt compound.
                    
                   
                    The second day is all for the children and youngsters in Chhattisgarh. They are all set from days before with Gulal (a red colour powder) and other dry colours, flower petals, water balloons, Pichkari (a toy used to throw water forcefully upon others) and sweets. Everyone colours each other in these colours and water.
                    
                    The weather and mood of people in Chhattisgarh is just like flowers. They all forget the fights and bad feelings for other and hug each other happily. The Holi celebration in Chhattisgarh is accompanied with yummy sweets like Gujjia, rasgullas etc.</p>

Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as nakadeng (or nakatheng), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called Thabal chongba on the full moon night of Lamta (Phalgun), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and fluorescent lamps. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with aber (gulal) wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near Imphal where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, Yaosang, a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.</p>

                <p>People in regions like Dimapur come out of their houses dresses in old clothes. They have colours in their hand, ready to be spread over the face of each person they meet on the way. The celebration takes place mostly in the outdoors and not amidst the houses.
                    The communities of Nagaland also follow the tradition and belief of playing Holi on two days. The first day of Holi celebration is said to be JalanewaliHoli where Holi bonfire takes place. 
                    The second day of Holi celebration in Nagaland is the one given more importance. The relevance of the Holi bonfire is not that widespread. This day is called the RnagwaliHoli, Dhulandi, Dhulendi or Dhuleti in some parts India. Children are more excited for this days celebration in Nagaland. And even elders participate in play of colour only to celebrate the joy of Holi. As they do not indulge in much happening affairs, having Dhols and exclusive food preparations on Holi is the sole focus! This sort of celebration is more popular in Hindu communities of Nagaland.

Dola Melana, processions of the deities are celebrated in villages and bhoga is offered to the deities.

                <p>Known for their love for life, Sikhs celebrate Holi in their own style and elan. At Punjab, they call it 'Hola Mohalla'. They shout, and shout their hearts out following a peculiar tradition. Besides, they also exhibit their martial arts specially 'kushti' on this day and make merry with the colours in the evening. Mouthwatering halwas, puris, gujias are of course, an essential part of the festivities.                    Holla Mohalla is celebrated a day after Holi in Punjab especially by the Nihang Sikhs.
                    The festival is celebrated with gusto at Anandpur Sahib for it was here that Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and last guru, instituted the pahul, elected the panj pyare, and militarized his followers into the order of Nihangs.
                    
                    This festival of the Nihangs held at their headquarters Anandpur Sahib began as a counterpart to Holi. Though it almost did away with the throwing of colors, nonetheless, it is more colorful.

                <p>The colourful state of Rajasthan plays Holi much the same way as Mathura. A night before the full moon, crowds of people gather together and light huge bonfires to burn the residual dried leaves and twigs of the winter. People throw coloured water and powders (gulal and kumkum) at each other and make merry. Singing, dancing and the traditional beats of dhol add to the gaiety of the occasion.

                    
                    On this day even the royals of Rajasthan don a festive spirit and mingle with the commoners. Infact, royal courts all over North India have refined the festival into an art. Rajput warriors of the Rajasthani courts used to show off their equestrian skills during the festival.
                    
                    Even today, Rajput men would ride their steeds through the white and pink clouds of colour, throwing colour powders on each other. Even the members of the royal families are not immune from being drenched by colour.</p>

The Holi songs of Braj Mandal are sung in pure Braj, the local language. Holi celebrated at Barsana is unique in the sense that here women chase men away with sticks who protect themselves with shields.
                    A traditional celebration includes Matki Phod, similar to Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and Gujarat, both in the memory of god Krishna who is also called makhan chor (literally, butter thief). This is a historic tradition of the Braj region as well as the western region of India.An earthen pot filled with butter or other milk products is hung high by a rope. Groups of boys and men climb on each other's shoulders to form pyramids to reach and break it, while girls and women sing songs and throw coloured water on the pyramid to distract them and make their job harder.This ritual sport continues in Hindu diaspora communities.

                    Kumaoni Holi in Uttarakhand includes a musical affair. It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas.  The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day. The Khari Holi is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people who dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the dhol.
In the Kumaon region, the Holika pyre, known as Cheer, is ceremonially built in a ceremony known as Cheer Bandhan fifteen days before Dulhendi. The Cheer is a bonfire with a green Paiya tree branch in the middle. The Cheer of every village and neighbourhood is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to playfully steal each other's cheer.

The colours used on Holi are derived from natural sources such as flower extracts, ash and water. Holi is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way all across North India.

                    In Bengal, Holi is known by the name of 'Dol Jatra', 'Dol Purnima' or the 'Swing Festival'. The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the idols of Krishna and Radha on a picturesquely decorated palanquin which is then taken round the main streets of the city. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing devotional songs. All this while men keep spraying coloured water and colour powder, 'abeer' at them.
                    The head of the family, observes fast and prays to Lord Krishna and Agnidev. After all the traditional rituals are over, he smears Krishna's idol with gulal and offers "bhog" to both Krishna and Agnidev. 
                    In West-Bengal, holi is best celebrated in Santiniketan. On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, the students dress up in saffron-coloured clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments presenting an enchanting view to the onlookers and a memory to cherish for years.
